(ns marketing.llm-realmodel
  "Real-model adapter for `marketing.llm`'s Advisor protocol — the piece
  that was genuinely missing before this file existed: `src/marketing/
  llm.cljc`'s MarketingOps-LLM was a SEALED/deterministic mock
  (`marketing.llm/mock-advisor`, `marketing.llm/infer`) with no way to
  point the actor at an actual language model. `marketing.llm.cljc`
  already defines the seam this needed — a generic `marketing.llm/
  llm-advisor` that wraps ANY `langchain.model/ChatModel` in the exact
  same `marketing.llm/Advisor` protocol (`-advise`) the OperationActor
  graph (`marketing.operation/build`) calls, with the identical proposal
  shape (`:summary`/`:rationale`/`:cites`/`:source`(always nil for this
  actor — see `marketing.llm`'s ns docstring)/`:effect`/`:value`/
  `:confidence`) parsed via `marketing.llm/parse-proposal`. This file does
  NOT change that graph-facing contract at all — it only supplies a
  second, real implementation of `ChatModel` for `llm-advisor` to wrap.

  JVM-only (`.clj`, not `.cljc`) for the same reason `marketing.http`/
  `marketing.file-store` are: a real outbound HTTP call to an external
  model API needs a real HTTP client, and there is no portable 'open a
  TCP socket to the internet' primitive at the kotoba-wasm/clojurewasm/
  cljs/nbb tier this fleet prefers (CLAUDE.md's `.cljc`/`.kotoba`
  runtime-priority section). This is infrastructure glue over
  `marketing.llm`'s already-portable domain logic, not a reimplementation
  of it. Mirrors `cloud-itonami-isic-5820`'s `src/crm/llm_realmodel.clj`
  (same design: config resolution, `preflight`, a JDK `HttpClient`-based
  `:http-fn`, delegating the actual wire logic to `langchain.model/
  openai-model`/`anthropic-model`), with this actor's own env var prefix
  so sibling `cloud-itonami-isic-*` actors on the same host/CI never
  collide on one another's model config.

  ## Convention: this org's own `ITO_MODEL_*` precedent, renamed per-actor

  `orgs/gftdcojp/cloud-itonami`'s `cloud_itonami.runtime` namespace
  already established exactly this shape for this same lineage/org:
  env-var-driven `ITO_MODEL_PROVIDER`/`ITO_MODEL_URL`/`ITO_MODEL`/
  `ITO_MODEL_API_KEY`, a JDK `HttpClient`-based `:http-fn`, an OpenAI-
  compatible + Anthropic adapter (both already implemented generically in
  `langchain.model`, not reimplemented here), and a `preflight` function
  that reports what's missing without ever attempting a live call.
  `cloud-itonami-isic-5820`'s `crm.llm-realmodel` adapted that SAME shape
  with an `ISIC5820_`-prefix; this file adapts it a second time with an
  `ISIC6201_`-prefix — deliberately not inventing an incompatible new
  shape either time:

    ISIC6201_MODEL_PROVIDER  \"openai\" (default) | \"anthropic\" | \"openclaw\"
                             (\"openclaw\" = any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
                             at a custom URL — self-hosted gateway, Ollama,
                             vLLM, etc. — same convention `cloud_itonami.
                             runtime`'s :openclaw/:hermes provider kind uses)
    ISIC6201_MODEL_URL       required for \"openclaw\" (no canonical default
                             endpoint); optional override for openai/
                             anthropic (defaults to the public API URL
                             `langchain.model` already hardcodes)
    ISIC6201_MODEL           chat model name (default: gpt-4o-mini for
                             openai/openclaw, claude-opus-4-8 for anthropic)
    ISIC6201_MODEL_API_KEY   the API key/bearer token. THE SOLE TRIGGER:
                             `marketing.http` switches from the sealed
                             mock advisor to this real-model advisor if
                             and only if this is set and non-blank (see
                             `marketing.http`'s `resolve-advisor!`).

  ## Honest, explicit gap this file does NOT close

  There are no model API credentials in the sandbox this file was built
  in (checked: no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY/OPENAI_API_KEY/etc. in env) — so a
  real end-to-end call through `real-advisor` to an actual model API has
  NEVER been exercised. What IS verified (see
  `test/marketing/llm_realmodel_test.clj`): `preflight`'s missing/present
  reporting across every permutation, and the exact JSON request/response
  shape this adapter sends/parses against a LOCAL http-kit stub server
  standing in for \"the model API\" (proves the adapter builds a
  well-formed OpenAI-compatible request and parses a well-formed response
  — it does NOT prove any real target model API actually accepts this
  exact request shape). An operator who supplies real credentials via
  `ISIC6201_MODEL_API_KEY` gets a genuinely wired adapter, but its
  real-call behavior remains unverified until they do."
