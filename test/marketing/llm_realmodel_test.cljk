  "Scrupulously honest about what this file DOES and does NOT prove:

  - `preflight` tests below exercise the FULL missing/present matrix with
    NO env vars and NO network access — this is fully testable offline
    and IS a genuine correctness proof of the reporting logic.
  - The request/response-shape tests start a REAL `org.httpkit.server`
    on an ephemeral localhost port and point `real-chat-model`/
    `real-advisor` at it via explicit `:url`/`:http-fn` opts — a real
    HTTP round-trip over a real socket happens, and the request the
    adapter actually sent (method/headers/JSON body) plus the parsed
    proposal from a canned response are both asserted. This proves the
    adapter builds a well-formed OpenAI-compatible chat-completions
    request and correctly parses a well-formed response.
  - NONE of this proves an ACTUAL model API (OpenAI/Anthropic/a real
    OpenAI-compatible gateway) accepts this exact request shape or
    behaves as the stub does — there are no credentials for any real
    model API in this sandbox, and this file does not pretend otherwise.
    That remains unverified until an operator with real credentials
    exercises it."
